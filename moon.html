        <h1 class="title">The Moon: Earth's Natural Satellite</h1>
        <p class="intro">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system. It has been a source of fascination for humanity throughout history, influencing culture, mythology, and scientific exploration.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="characteristics">
            <li class="fade-in">Size and Composition: Diameter of approximately 3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles), about one-quarter the size of Earth.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Orbit and Rotation: Orbits Earth at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) and takes 27.3 days to complete one orbit and rotation.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Phases and Eclipses: Goes through eight distinct phases each lunar month and can experience lunar and solar eclipses.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Surface Features: Marked by craters, mountains, and dark plains known as "maria," formed by ancient volcanic activity.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Gravity and Atmosphere: Has a gravitational pull about one-sixth that of Earth and a very thin atmosphere called an exosphere.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Exploration: The site of significant exploration, most notably during NASAâ€™s Apollo program, with the first manned landing on July 20, 1969.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="conclusion">The Moon remains an essential object of study in astronomy and planetary science, with ongoing exploration efforts aimed at returning humans to its surface.</p>
