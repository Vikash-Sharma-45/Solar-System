        <h1 class="title">Earth: Our Home Planet</h1>
        <p class="intro">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. Its unique combination of atmosphere, water, and suitable climate makes it a diverse and vibrant planet. Earth is often referred to as the "Blue Planet" due to the vast oceans that cover approximately 71% of its surface.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="characteristics">
            <li class="fade-in">Size and Composition: Diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles), making it the largest of the terrestrial planets.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Orbit and Rotation: Orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles) and takes about 365.25 days to complete one orbit.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Atmosphere: Composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, essential for supporting life.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Water and Climate: Features vast oceans, rivers, and lakes, with a climate that varies widely across regions.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Biodiversity: Home to millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms, adapted to their unique environments.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Geological Activity: Geologically active with tectonic plates causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Exploration: Extensively studied through satellite observations, remote sensing, and field research.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="conclusion">Earth's unique combination of atmosphere, water, and life makes it a remarkable planet. As humanity faces challenges like climate change, understanding and protecting our home is crucial for the future.</p>
