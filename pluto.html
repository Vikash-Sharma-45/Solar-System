        <h1 class="title">Pluto: The Dwarf Planet</h1>
        <p class="intro">Pluto, once considered the ninth planet of our solar system, is now classified as a dwarf planet. Discovered in 1930, Pluto has captivated scientists and the public alike with its unique characteristics, intriguing geology, and complex atmosphere.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="characteristics">
            <li class="fade-in">Size and Composition: Diameter of approximately 2,377 kilometers (1,477 miles), making it smaller than Earth's Moon.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Orbit and Rotation: Orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 5.9 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles) and takes about 248 Earth years to complete one orbit.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Atmosphere: Thin atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide; expands and contracts based on its distance from the Sun.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Moons: Five known moons, with Charon being the largest, nearly half the size of Pluto, and leading to the classification of the Pluto-Charon system as a double dwarf planet system.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Geological Features: Diverse geological features, including ice plains, water ice mountains, and potential cryovolcanoes; Sputnik Planitia is a notable region made of nitrogen ice.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Exploration: Visited by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in July 2015, providing the first close-up images and data about Pluto and its moons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="conclusion">Pluto remains a unique and enigmatic world on the fringes of our solar system, offering valuable insights into the formation and evolution of planetary bodies.</p>
