        <h1 class="title">Saturn: The Ringed Planet</h1>
        <p class="intro">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system, known for its stunning rings and numerous moons. A gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, Saturn has captivated astronomers and space enthusiasts alike due to its beauty and complexity.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="characteristics">
            <li class="fade-in">Size and Composition: Diameter of approximately 116,464 kilometers (72,366 miles), making it about 9.5 times larger than Earth.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Orbit and Rotation: Orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 1.4 billion kilometers (886 million miles) with a year lasting about 29.5 Earth years.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Rings: Famous for its extensive and bright ring system, composed of ice and rock particles, which are relatively thin and measure only a few hundred meters in thickness.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Moons: Home to over 80 known moons, with Titan being the largest and featuring a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Magnetic Field: Has a strong magnetic field, about 578 times that of Earth, generated by the motion of metallic hydrogen in its interior.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Exploration: Studied by several spacecraft, including the Cassini-Huygens mission, which provided comprehensive data about the planet, rings, and moons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="conclusion">Saturn is a majestic gas giant that holds a special place in our solar system due to its remarkable rings and diverse moons. Its beauty and complexity continue to inspire scientific exploration and discovery.</p>
