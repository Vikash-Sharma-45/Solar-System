        <h1 class="title">Venus: The Earth's Twin</h1>
        <p class="intro">Venus, often referred to as Earth's twin due to its similar size and composition, is the second planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is known for its thick, toxic atmosphere and extreme surface temperatures, making it one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="characteristics">
            <li class="fade-in">Size and Composition: Diameter of approximately 12,104 kilometers (7,521 miles), primarily made up of silicate rocks and metals.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Orbit and Rotation: Orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 108.2 million kilometers (67.2 million miles) with a retrograde rotation that takes about 243 Earth days.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Atmosphere: Thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide (about 96.5%) and nitrogen (about 3.5%), with clouds of sulfuric acid.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Surface Features: Rocky surface with vast plains, highland regions, and large volcanic structures like Maat Mons.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Exploration: Visited by several spacecraft, including the Soviet Venera probes and NASA's Magellan mission.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="conclusion">Despite its beauty and brightness, Venus is one of the harshest environments in our solar system, offering insights into planetary evolution and the potential for life.</p>
