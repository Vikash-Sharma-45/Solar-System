        <h1 class="title">Mercury: The Swiftest Planet</h1>
        <p class="intro">Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in our solar system, known for its extreme temperatures and lack of atmosphere. It is a rocky planet with a surface marked by craters, similar to Earth's Moon.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="characteristics">
            <li class="fade-in">Size and Composition: Diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles), primarily composed of iron and silicate rock.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Orbit and Rotation: Orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 57.91 million kilometers (36 million miles) with an orbit period of 88 Earth days.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Temperature Extremes: Daytime temperatures can reach up to 430 째C (800 째F), while nighttime can drop to -180 째C (-290 째F).</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Surface Features: Heavily cratered surface with notable features like the Caloris Basin.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Atmosphere: Very thin atmosphere composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Exploration: First visited by Mariner 10; more recently studied by the MESSENGER spacecraft.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="conclusion">Mercury offers valuable insights into the formation of the solar system and continues to be a subject of scientific interest and exploration.</p>
