        <h1 class="title">Uranus: The Ice Giant</h1>
        <p class="intro">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is classified as an ice giant due to its unique composition and atmospheric characteristics. It is known for its striking blue color, which is a result of methane in its atmosphere, and its unusual tilt, which gives it extreme seasonal variations.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="characteristics">
            <li class="fade-in">Size and Composition: Diameter of approximately 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles), making it the third-largest planet in the solar system by diameter.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Orbit and Rotation: Orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 2.87 billion kilometers (1.78 billion miles) with a year lasting about 84 Earth years.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Atmosphere and Weather: Characterized by high-speed winds and cold temperatures, with an upper atmosphere dropping to around -224 degrees Celsius (-371 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Rings and Moons: Has a faint ring system composed of ice and rock particles, and 27 known moons, with the five largest being Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Magnetic Field: Features a unique magnetic field tilted about 59 degrees from its rotational axis, generated by the motion of electrically conductive fluids.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Exploration: Visited by Voyager 2 in 1986, providing the first close-up images of Uranus and its moons, revealing many intriguing features.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="conclusion">Uranus is a fascinating ice giant that stands out in our solar system due to its unique composition, unusual tilt, and striking color. Its distant location and intriguing features make it a prime target for future exploration.</p>
