        <h1 class="title">Mars: The Red Planet</h1>
        <p class="intro">Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. Its reddish appearance comes from iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Mars has long captivated human imagination and scientific inquiry due to its similarities to Earth and the possibility of past or present life.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="characteristics">
            <li class="fade-in">Size and Composition: Diameter of approximately 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles), making it about half the size of Earth.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Orbit and Rotation: Orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 227.9 million kilometers (141.6 million miles) with a Martian year lasting about 687 Earth days.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Surface Features: Home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Atmosphere: Thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide (about 95.3%), leading to extreme temperature fluctuations.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Water Presence: Evidence suggests liquid water once flowed on Mars, with polar ice caps made of water and frozen carbon dioxide.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Exploration: Explored by numerous missions, including rovers like Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="conclusion">Mars is a planet of immense interest for scientists and the public, serving as a key target for exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life. Its unique characteristics make it a prime candidate for future human exploration.</p>
