        <h1 class="title">Jupiter: The Giant of the Solar System</h1>
        <p class="intro">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in our solar system. Known as a gas giant, it has a thick atmosphere composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's massive size and distinct features make it one of the most fascinating planets to study.</p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <ul class="characteristics">
            <li class="fade-in">Size and Composition: Diameter of approximately 139,822 kilometers (86,881 miles), making it about 11 times larger than Earth.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Orbit and Rotation: Orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 778.5 million kilometers (484 million miles) with a Jovian year lasting about 11.9 Earth years.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Atmosphere and Weather: Features iconic bands of clouds, storms, and high-speed winds, including the Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Magnetic Field: Has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the solar system, about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Moons and Rings: Home to 79 known moons, including the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. It has a faint ring system composed of dust and small particles.</li>
            <li class="fade-in">Exploration: Studied by several spacecraft, including the Galileo orbiter and the Juno spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the planet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="conclusion">Jupiter is a colossal gas giant that plays a crucial role in our solar system. Its immense size, complex atmosphere, and intriguing moons make it a prime target for scientific research and exploration.</p>
